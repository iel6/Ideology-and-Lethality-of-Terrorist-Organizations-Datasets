# Ideology and Lethality of Terrorist Organizations Datasets

I used the data stored in this repository to conduct the research for the article entitled "Ideology and the Lethality of Terrorist Organizations," published online on October 15, 2021 in the journal Terrorism and Political Violence. The article can be found here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2021.1977282

I constructed the two main datasets used with data from two databases: 
  1) The Global Terrorism Database (GTD), housed at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. The GTD is the world's largest database on terrorist attacks, containing event-level data from 1970 to the present. As of October 2019, the GTD is open-access for anyone using it for scholarly, educational, or research purposes. For more information and access to the database, please see START's website: https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/access/
  2) The Revolutionary and Militant Organizations Dataset (REVMOD), created and maintained by conflict studies scholar Benjamin Acosta and introduced in 2019 (see, https://480e7569-bb4b-49c5-9961-96a05120235a.filesusr.com/ugd/fff6b2_fde9f65702204b3cb269dfa08a2fc03e.pdf). REVMOD contains organization- and organization-year-level data on over 500 "resistance organizations" generally active in the post-WWII period. The dataset is open-access to all as of the time of writing here: https://www.revolutionarymilitant.org/

This repository contains the two main datasets I used to conduct the tests described in the aforementioned article. One is compiled at the organization level and the other at the organization-year level. Because I used the Stata/IC 15.1 software to run regressions, I have included my coding in .do file format. The .do files record the exact coding I used to give readers the transparency needed to better understand my study and conduct replication analysis. Readers should also feel free to use my datasets in further research, provided my article is properly credited in any future work that does use my datasets. Finally, I have included a file - made with the gracious assistance of Dr. Eric Dunford - coded with the R software that I used to create the list of organizations included in my final samples.
